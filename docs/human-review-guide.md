# Human Review Guide

How to handle strategies that the pipeline flagged as needing attention. Written for staff engineers and tech leads who review strategy output.

> **Audience**: Staff engineers on RHAI team who receive `strat-creator-needs-attention` notifications from the strategy pipeline.

## When Does This Happen?

The strategy pipeline scores every strategy on four dimensions (Feasibility, Testability, Scope, Architecture), each 0-2. Only strategies that score **6+ total with no zeros** auto-approve. Everything else gets a `strat-creator-needs-attention` label and waits for you.

| Verdict | Trigger | What It Means |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **REVISE** | total >= 3, at most 1 zero | Fixable quality issues. A dimension or two scored low but the approach is sound |
| **REJECT** | total < 3 or 2+ zeros | Fundamental problems. The strategy won't work as written |

## What You'll See

1. A **Jira comment** on the RHAISTRAT ticket with the score table and a summary of issues
2. The `strat-creator-needs-attention` label on the ticket
3. A **review file** in `artifacts/strat-reviews/STRAT-NNN-review.md` with detailed prose from 4 independent reviewers (feasibility, testability, scope, architecture)

You can browse review files in the [strat-creator dashboard](https://strat-dashboard-0f1209.gitlab.io/) (temporary dry-run URL), or run the pipeline locally in dry-run mode to see the full review output. Dry-run mode is recommended for exploring reviews without side effects.

Read the review file first. It tells you exactly what each AI reviewer found.

## The Golden Rule

**Never edit the strategy text directly.** The strategy text (under `## Strategy`) is AI-generated output. If you edit it, the next refine run will overwrite your changes.

Instead, you have two inputs that feed into strategy refinement:

1. **Staff Engineer Input section**, in the strategy file itself, under `## Staff Engineer Input`
2. **Architecture context**, the platform architecture docs in opendatahub-io/architecture-context

Edit the inputs, rerun the pipeline, and let it regenerate the output.

## How to Fix a Strategy

### Local Setup

#### Prerequisites

1. Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) if you don't have it yet.

2. Set the required environment variables:

```bash
# Jira credentials (required, the pipeline fetches RFEs from Jira)
export JIRA_SERVER="https://redhat.atlassian.net"
export JIRA_USER="your-email@redhat.com"
export JIRA_TOKEN="your-atlassian-api-token"

# Anthropic API key (required, powers the AI pipeline)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key"
```

To generate a Jira API token, go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens.

3. Clone the strat-creator repo (you only need to do this once):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ederign/strat-creator.git
cd strat-creator
```

#### Generate Artifacts Locally

Run the full pipeline in dry-run mode for the RFE you want to work on. Dry-run is safe, it reads from Jira but never writes back:

```bash
# Replace RHAIRFE-1146 with the RFE ID for your strategy
claude -p "/strategy.create RHAIRFE-1146 --dry-run"
claude -p "/strategy.refine --dry-run"
claude -p "/strategy.review --dry-run"
```

After the run completes, you'll have:
- Strategy files in `artifacts/strat-tasks/`
- Review files in `artifacts/strat-reviews/`
- An HTML report in `artifacts/reports/report.html`

### Step 1: Read the Review

Browse the review in our [dashboard](https://strat-dashboard-0f1209.gitlab.io/), or open `artifacts/strat-reviews/STRAT-NNN-review.md` locally. Look at:
- The **score table**: which dimensions failed?
- The **prose reviews**: what specifically did each reviewer flag?
- The **disagreements section**: where did reviewers diverge?

> **Note on scoring drift:** LLM-based grading is non-deterministic. Scores may vary slightly between runs, even with the same input. Use scores as directional signals, not exact measurements. If a score seems borderline or surprising, focus on the prose reviews. They explain the reasoning behind the score.

### Step 2: Choose Your Fix Path

| Path | When to Use | What to Edit | What to Rerun |
|------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **A: Update architecture context** (recommended) | The reviewer found wrong dependencies, missing integration patterns, outdated platform info, or component gaps | Architecture context repo (opendatahub-io/architecture-context) | refine → review |
| **B: Strategy-specific fix** | The issue is specific to this one strategy (wrong effort estimate, missing test criteria, scope needs narrowing) | `## Staff Engineer Input` section in the strategy file | refine → review |
| **C: Both** | Architecture gaps AND strategy-specific issues | Both architecture context and Staff Engineer Input | refine → review |

**Path A is the recommended default.** Architecture context fixes are durable. They improve all future strategies, not just the one you're fixing. If the pipeline produced a bad strategy, the most likely root cause is that the architecture context was missing or wrong. Fix the source, not the symptom.

Use Path B only when the issue is truly unique to one strategy (e.g., a specific effort estimate or a scope decision that doesn't generalize).

**All paths require rerunning refine then review.** Refine regenerates the strategy text using your inputs. Review re-scores the regenerated output.

### Step 3: Write Your Input

#### Path A: Update Architecture Context (Recommended)

If the reviewer flagged a wrong dependency, missing component, or outdated integration pattern, the fix belongs in the architecture context repo, not in the strategy file. Update the relevant docs in opendatahub-io/architecture-context. This makes the fix permanent for all future pipeline runs.

> **Need help?** Contact James Tanner or Luca Burgazzoli for instructions on how to update the architecture context repo.

Common architecture context updates:
- Component ownership or boundaries changed
- A new integration pattern was adopted
- A dependency was added, removed, or deprecated
- Platform constraints that affect multiple strategies

After updating the architecture context, rerun `/strategy.refine`. It will fetch the updated context and regenerate the strategy accordingly.

#### Path B: Strategy-Specific Fix

Open the strategy file (`artifacts/strat-tasks/STRAT-NNN.md`) and find the `## Staff Engineer Input` section. Add your guidance there. Examples:

**For a REVISE (testability gap):**
```markdown
## Staff Engineer Input

The acceptance criteria need to include API response time benchmarks.
Target: p95 < 200ms for the model registry lookup endpoint.
Edge case the reviewer missed: handle the case where the registry
returns a 404 for a model that was soft-deleted.
```

**For a REVISE (effort estimate):**
```markdown
## Staff Engineer Input

Effort estimate is too low. This touches the inference controller
and the model registry, two teams need to coordinate. Estimate
should be M not S. Add a dependency on RHAISTRAT-1200 which is
refactoring the registry API.
```

**For a scope issue:**
```markdown
## Staff Engineer Input

Scope is too broad. Tighten to model registry API for version
management only. Dashboard UI for model version comparison should
be a separate RFE.
```

> **Important:** If you edited the `## Staff Engineer Input` section during this dry-run stage, send the updated markdown file to Eder so he can include it in the production run on Jira.

### Step 4: Rerun the Pipeline

From your local `strat-creator` directory (see [Local Setup](#local-setup)), rerun refine and review:

```bash
claude -p "/strategy.refine --dry-run"
claude -p "/strategy.review --dry-run"
```

In CI, this happens automatically on the next pipeline run after you remove the `strat-creator-needs-attention` label.

### Step 5: Check the Result

Look at the new review file. Did the scores improve? If the strategy now scores 6+ with no zeros, it auto-approves.

If it still doesn't pass, repeat from Step 1. The cycle continues until the strategy approves.

## What Each Verdict Typically Needs

### REVISE

Most common. Usually one or two dimensions scored low. Typical fixes:

| Low Dimension | Common Fix |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Feasibility** | Add risk mitigation, clarify technical approach, adjust effort estimate |
| **Testability** | Add measurable acceptance criteria, specify edge cases, define test matrix |
| **Scope** | Tighten boundaries, remove bundled concerns, clarify what's out of scope |
| **Architecture** | Correct component dependencies, specify integration patterns, align with platform direction |

### REJECT

Rare but serious. Two or more dimensions have fundamental problems. Options:
- Go back to the source RFE, maybe the RFE itself needs rework
- Write extensive Staff Engineer Input to redirect the strategy approach entirely
- Flag to the team that this feature needs a design discussion before pipeline re-entry

## Key Rules

1. **Never edit strategy text directly.** Edit the inputs (architecture context or Staff Engineer Input), not the output
2. **Prefer architecture context fixes.** They're durable and benefit all future strategies, not just the one you're fixing
3. **Always rerun refine before review.** Review scores what refine produces, not what you wrote
4. **`strat-creator-needs-attention` is one-way.** Only humans remove it, automation never clears it
5. **Use Staff Engineer Input for one-off fixes.** Effort estimates, scope decisions, and other things that don't generalize
